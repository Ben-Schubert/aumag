In early September, the European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference (EWTEC) took place in Naples, Italy. One member of our group (Ben), presented his work on incorperating magnetic features into an ocean wave energy converter to enhance the energy harvesting performance through passive bistable control. Many interesting research areas from around the world were presented, including methods of optimise buoy shape, improved hydrodynamic models for high fidelity models, and even control strategies and considerations when connecting to the grid for utility scale power generation.

As part of the conference, there was also an opportunity to see a prototype device in situ forming part of a break water.

It was encouraging to see the breadth of research within the field and the openness to novel solutions such as the use of magnets within aspects of this budding industry. We're always on the lookout for bright ideas involving magnets :bulb:.
